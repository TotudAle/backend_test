###### BACK-END TEST #######

To download the project, just clone this repository.

This realisation was written in PHP. 

The code and tool (excel file) for the technical test can be found in the directory "**Code Simudyne**".
The file *"index.php"* is the main file.
The other directory is PHPExcel library. I used it to read and write into excel files.

My excel files have the extension ".xlsx" (Excel 2007)

**/!\  As it is said in the comments in the code, this code is working for an Excel file which contains exclusiely the data.
This means that the initial file provided won't work due to the equations and text present in it  /!\**
